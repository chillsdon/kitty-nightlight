A simple sketch to run a NeoPixel strip curled up inside a glass instant coffee jar. NeoPixels are driven from an Adafruit Trinket M0 using Arduino code (the M0 is not powerful enough to run multiple animations from the Adafruit LED Animation library using CircuitPython) which is housed in a custom 3D printed jar lid which also incorporates a button to toggle between animations, and locates/locks using magnets.
